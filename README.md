# Problem

Ideally, getting complete information to start a business in Nigeria shouldn't take months. However,  individuals currently seeking information to start a business in Nigeria are faced with inadequate information, inefficient use of time and resources, yet the information provided are highly generic, likewise, there are individuals (Workers/retirees/Nigeria in diaspora) who are willing to invest but are not sure of the business to and how to key in without direct involvement.

# Proposed Solution

We shall be breaking the barrier between the business start-up information, passionate entrepreneurs and investors by creating an investment portal for Nigerian youths to attract individuals (individuals on their career path or about to retire, Nigerians in diaspora and friends of Nigeria) interested in owning part or whole of business by interest, location, and budget in Nigeria.

# Proposed Stack

Backend - PHP/Laravel 
Frontend - JS/vueJs 
Database - MySQL
Build tool - NPM, Webpack

# Benefit

- Our target audience will have quick access to detailed business information.
- More Nigeria Youths will be paid for providing accurate information.
- Increase rate of busniess growth.
