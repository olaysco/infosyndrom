# Problem

The majority of individuals with the desire and capacity to start a business in Nigeria have limited access to complete information by interest, location, and budget. Those that have will have to pay a premium and a long waiting time to get the desired information.   The individuals with the passion and energy to execute the businesses lack access to funding as the individuals are required to have some level of financing or be able to employ the service of someone who has one, likewise, there are individuals (Workers/retirees/Nigeria in diaspora) who are willing to invest but are not sure of the business to and how to key in without direct involvement.

# Proposed Solution

We shall be breaking the barrier between the business start-up information, passionate entrepreneurs and investors by creating an investment portal for Nigerian youths to attract individuals (individuals on their career path or about to retire, Nigerians in diaspora and friends of Nigeria) interested in owning part or whole of business by interest, location, and budget in Nigeria.

# Proposed Stack

Backend - PHP/Laravel 
Frontend - JS/vueJs 
Database - MySQL
Build tool - NPM, Webpack

# Benefit

- Quick access to funding for business owners.
- Secured investments for first time investors.
- Increase rate of busniess growth.
