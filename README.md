# Problem

Ideally, getting complete information to start a business in Nigeria shouldn't take months. However,  individuals currently seeking information to start a business in Nigeria are faced with inadequate information, inefficient use of time and resources, yet the information provided are highly generic. Also, there are individuals (Workers/retirees/Nigeria in diaspora) who are willing to own a business but they don't have the time to manage the business.

# Proposed Solution

We shall be Creating a platform where individuals can provide verified business information and get paid for it while start ups can access such information at an affordable price.
Our platform will also serve as an avenue  where individuals (Workers/retirees/Nigeria in diaspora) can  become investors.

# Proposed Stack

Backend - PHP/Laravel 
Frontend - JS/vueJs 
Database - MySQL
Build tool - NPM, Webpack

# Benefit

- More Nigeria Youths will be paid for providing accurate information.
- Increase rate of busniess growth.
